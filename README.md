I am working on Genome-scale Metabolic reconstruction for Geobacillus LC300.
I have downloaded the draft model from the MODELSEED database and am currently doing manual curation.

Genome Scale Metabolic reconstruction is essentially simulating the cell's metabolic environment and understanding its growth parameters as we vary different parameters such as intial metabolites concentrations, pH, etc.

My goal is to understand the changes in growth parameters of Geobacillus LC300 when there is change in Oxygen concentraction or Glucose concentration.
